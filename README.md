Mozart
======

**Mozart** is an open source framework for **Wordpress**, based on the [**Symfony2**](http://symfony.com) framework. It helps you write solid code for your plugin or theme. It is designed for big Wordpress projects.

Mozart is constructed from fully decoupled components (bundles in Symfony2 glossary), which means that every feature can be used in any other application.

#### Under heavy development. Not ready for production
