ACF5 Beta
=========

Welcome to the Advanced Custom Fields v5 beta repository. This repository will provide an effective workflow for issue tracking during the final stages of this build process.

V5 is a brand new ACF plugin which has been completely re-written from the ground up to solve many of the limitations that V4 suffered (due to its growth over a 2 year period). There are lots of new features including new fields, settings, designs and functionality! All of which focus on creating a cleaner and more powerful interface for WordPress websites.

Rules
-----
* Please fully read this `README.md`
* Please pull the latest code before any testing
* Please don't share, leak or distribute any code from this repository

How to report an issue
----------------------

All issues are to be reported here: [Create a new issue](https://github.com/elliotcondon/acf5-beta/issues/). Please provide a clear title and comment that describes what the issue is, why it is an issue and how the issue can be recreated. If possible, please provide any errors, code snippets or attachments to aid your description.

Installation
------------

ACF5 introduces a new way to unlock premium add-ons. Previously, each add-on could be purchased and installed separately which made rolling out updates slow and cumbersome. To fix this, ACF5 can be upgraded from the `Free` version to a `PRO` version! The pro version will be purchased with either a single or multi-site license. 

For the duration of this beta testing, a developer license will be made available to all beta testers:
`cHVyY2hhc2VkPTI1MjQ3fHR5cGU9c2luZ2xlfGRhdGU9MjAxNC0wMS0xNyAwMzoyNToxOQ==`

To correctly install ACF5 for beta testing, please follow these steps:

1. Setup a new local WP installation or use an existing one
2. Disabled the `advanced-custom-fields` plugin if already exists
3. Clone this repository into a new folder: `wp-content/plugins/advanced-custom-fields-pro`
4. Activate the `advanced-custom-fields-pro` plugin via wp-admin
5. Navigate to `Custom Fields -> Updates` and enter the above License Key to unlock updates

### Notes regarding updates

Please do not update the plugin via the `Custom Fields -> Updates` page as this will destroy your `git` data. Instead, please test that the page functionality is working correctly.

The files in this git repository represent the files available for download using a purchased developer license. All `PRO` functionality is included in a `pro` folder. Removing this folder will represent the `FREE` version.
